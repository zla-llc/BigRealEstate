## 🛠️ Installation

The project provides two helper scripts to install the required tools.

| Platform                     | Script            | Run steps                                         |
| ---------------------------- | ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| **macOS**                    | `brew_install.sh` | `chmod +x brew_install.sh`<br>`./brew_install.sh` |
| **Windows** (Git‑Bash / WSL) | `yum_install.sh`  | `chmod +x yum_install.sh`<br>`./yum_install.sh`   |

The `chmod +x` command makes the script executable; it must be executed **once** before the first run.
