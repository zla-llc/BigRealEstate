# Zala API Route Reference

This document summarizes the REST endpoints exposed by the FastAPI service so the UI can wire requests without digging through the backend.

- **Base URL**: all application routes sit under the `/api` prefix unless noted.
- **Authentication**: no tokens yet; just supply the JSON payloads described below.
- **Pagination**: collection GETs accept `skip` and `limit` query params (default `0` and `100`).

## Root

| Method | Path | Purpose | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| GET | `/` | Health check | Returns `{"message": "Zala API is running"}`; no auth required. |

## CSV Intake (`/api/import-csv/`)

| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| POST | `/api/import-csv/` | Upload CSV/XLSX of contacts/leads | `multipart/form-data` with file field `file` | Summary with counts and lists: created/updated contacts & leads, skipped rows, errors |

Allowed file MIME types: `text/csv`, `application/vnd.ms-excel`, and `.xlsx`. The backend normalizes headers (snake_case, lowercase) and merges rows by email/phone.

---

## Lead Search (`/api/searchLeads`)

| Method | Path | Purpose | Body Fields | Response |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| POST | `/api/searchLeads` | Fan-out search across one or more data sources | `location_text` (string) plus `sources` (array containing any of `"db"`, `"rapidapi"`, `"google_places"`, `"gpt"`) | Per-source `results` (each with `leads` and optional metadata) and per-source `errors` when a provider fails |

Notes:
- When a single source is requested, the matching entry in `results` mirrors the legacy payloads (for example, `rapidapi`/`google_places`/`gpt`/`db` return `leads` with `distance_miles`).
- If geocoding fails or a provider rejects the request, the reason is listed under `errors[source]`.
- `location_text` can be a zip code or free-form description; the backend geocodes and extracts any dynamic filters automatically.
- Leads returned from external sources include a temporary positive `lead_id` so frontends can key list items consistently; IDs increment across sources within the same response.
- External provider quotas: RapidAPI requests reset monthly with a cap of 95 calls, and Brave search requests (used by the GPT integration) are limited to 1,950 calls per month.

## Send Campaign Email (`/api/campaign-emails/send`)

| Method | Path | Purpose | Body Fields | Response |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| POST | `/api/campaign-emails/send` | Send one email template to multiple leads already linked to the campaign | `campaign_id` (int), `lead_id` (array of lead IDs), `message_subject` (string), `message_body` (string) | Hydrated `CampaignPublic` object for the campaign after the messages are queued |

Notes:
- `lead_id` must include at least one ID, and every ID must already be linked to the specified campaign via `/api/campaign-leads`.
- The endpoint records one `CampaignEmail` per lead and flips the `email_contacted` flag for each matching campaign-lead link.
- Useful for bulk drip sends where the UI already has a campaign selection and filtered lead list.

---

### Usage Tips for Frontend Developers

- Always hit the `/api` prefixed route (e.g., `/api/leads`), even when an endpoint is described relative to a resource group.
- For create/update forms, supply only the fields marked required; optional fields can be omitted rather than sent as `null`.
- Use the linking endpoints instead of including relationship IDs in create payloads—this keeps flows simple and mirrors backend expectations.
- Most GET endpoints support `skip`/`limit` pagination; keep them in query strings even if you default to `skip=0&limit=100`.
